## **Overview**

There are multiple challenge tracks, but it is up to you and your teammates to work on one or multiples to present a project in alignment with the judging criteria.

The convergence of quantum science and global sustainability efforts is unlocking a new horizon of possibility. Quantum computing provides a transformative toolkit to achieve the ambitious vision of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, offering powerful new approaches to problems in simulation, optimization, and foundational computation itself. [1]

This Q3 USC hackathon, supported by IBM, is structured as a direct inquiry into quantum's potential, presenting a series of challenges across critical domains:
- Reversible computing: Probing the principles of reversible computing to address the fundamental energy cost of information processing
- Complex optimization problem: Untangling intractable logistical and energy-grid puzzles
- Natural Simulations: Modeling the very building blocks of nature to accelerate the discovery of new medicines and materials.

Your goal is to engage with one of these core challenges. Beyond simply implementing an algorithm, you are challenged to consider the deeper questions of real-world application and the broader social context of your work.

## Track 1: Feynman's dream - Reversible computing

This track is your conceptual entry point into the quantum world, starting with a foundational question that puzzled the pioneers of computing: Can we compute reversibly?

### Reversible computing

In classical computers, most logic gates are `irreversible`. For example, and AND gate outputs `0` for three different inputs (`00`, `01`, `10`). If you only have the output, you can't know the input - information has been lost. According to Landauer's Principles, this act of erasing information fundamentally s energy dissipation, making computation inherently inefficient. A **reversible computation**, in contrast, is one where you can always reverse the process to find the original input from the output, meaning no information is lost. [2]

The idea of reversible computing was advanced significantly by Charles Bennett, who showed that any classical computation could be performed in a logically reversible manner. Building on this, Richard Feynman noted that the laws of quantum mechanics are themselves inherently reversible and thus proposed that a computer built on quantum principles could be the ideal physical implementation of a reversible computer.[3] [4]

### Your Challenge

Your challenge is to explore Feynman's vision. Using Qiskit, design and demonstrate a non-trivial computation that is fully reversible. Take a simple classical process that is normally irreversible, like the `AND` operation previously mentioned, and show how it can be constructed using only reversible quantum gates. Your goal is not only to build a working circuit but also to understand and explain why your quantum implementation is fundamentally reversible. Plus point if you run your circuit at the real QPU and analyze it.

### Start from here
- The Reversible Quantum Calculator: Could you build a circuit that performs binary addition where the original input number can be fully recovered from the output state?
- The Quantum Game: Could you design a simple game where every move is reversible? This can be a `rock-paper-scissor`, `tic-tac-toe` or a `guessing game`.
- Reversible Data Processing: Could you design a circuit that checks if a binary string is a palindrome (`1001`) without erasing any of the intermediate steps?

## Track 2: Quantum Optimization for Impact

This track is for participants ready to explore one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers: solving complex optimization problems.

### Quantum for Optimization Problem

Many real-world problems‚Äîfrom logistics and finance to drug development‚Äîare fundamentally optimization problems. The challenge is that as the number of variables increases, the number of possible solutions can grow exponentially, becoming too vast for even the most powerful supercomputers to search exhaustively. This is where quantum computers offer a new approach. By leveraging principles like superposition and interference, a quantum algorithm can explore a huge number of potential solutions simultaneously, finding high-quality approximate solutions to problems that are otherwise intractable.


### Your Challenge: Solve Real-World Optimization Problem

A single quantum algorithm, like the `Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)`, can be adapted to solve a wide range of problems [1], [2], [3]. Your challenge is to choose one of the following classic optimization problems, frame it as a real-world issue, and use Qiskit to find an approximate solution.

### Start from here:

- The Traveling Salesperson (TSP) - Efficient Logistics: This challenge addresses Climate Action by minimizing fuel consumption and carbon emissions in transportation and logistics. Try to model a scenario where a vehicle must find the most efficient route to visit a small number of cities (e.g., 3-4) and return home.

- The Max-Cut Problem - Uncovering Network Structures: This challenge can be applied to Sustainable Cities by optimizing community planning or to Peace and Justice by identifying polarized groups in social networks. Try to model a graph of nodes (e.g., people, locations) and find the optimal way to divide them into two distinct groups to maximize the connections (or disagreements) between them.
- The Knapsack Problem - Strategic Resource Allocation: This challenge addresses numerous real-world problems by finding the best way to allocate limited resources, such as distributing a budget across non-profit projects to maximize social impact. Try to model a scenario where you have a set of items, each with a cost and a value (e.g., projects with a budget and an impact score). Your goal is to choose the combination of items that provides the maximum possible value without exceeding a total budget.[3]

## Track 3: Quantum Chemistry for Sustainable Technologies

The global transition to a sustainable future depends on the discovery of novel materials. Whether for next-generation batteries, efficient carbon capture, or green catalysts, the key lies in understanding and predicting the complex quantum interactions within molecules. Simulating these properties accurately is a profound challenge where quantum computers are expected to provide a significant advantage.

### Your challenge: Apply an advanced quantum chemistry algorithm to a molecule of your choice

You should use methods that go beyond standard ground state calculations, such as advanced solvers for computing specific molecular properties. This includes techniques like `Quantum Subspace Diagonalization (QSD)`, `Sampling-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD)` for analyzing molecular behavior. Your goal is to:

1. Select a molecule that interests you.
2. Identify a key chemical property to investigate (e.g., excited state energies, dipole moment, etc.).
3. Implement the simulation using Qiskit and appropriate classical chemistry software.
4. Interpret your results in the context of the molecule's potential application.

**Bonus Points:**  Teams that choose to simulate a molecule directly relevant to a sustainability challenge will receive bonus points. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- A component of a next-generation battery (e.g., a simple electrolyte or cathode molecule).
- A molecule involved in carbon capture or catalysis.
- A molecule relevant to understanding environmental pollutants.
